        <h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying Business Administration and Bible with a pastoral focus. Because of my double major, I do not have a job. I am currently the treasurer for my society.</p>
         <p>
           I am currently going to Morning Side Baptist church and enjoy serving there. I grew up as an evangelist kid, so I grew up on the road 40 weeks of the year. I have been able to travel lots of different
             places including Ireland, Italy, and New Zealand.  
         
         <p>
            I am very much a red neck. I love hunting, fishing, playing guitar, trucks, camouflage, hiking, and blowing stuff up. I am also a knife maker. I do what is called the stock-removal method. 
             I start with a flat bar of steel and the grind the shape out. I then grind bevels to form an edge, put a handle on the knife, and then sharpen the knife. Knife making is my favorite hobby;
             I hope to be a master at it one day.
