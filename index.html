        <h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University and I am doing a double major in Business Administration and in Biblical Studies. I am very busy doing two majors so I am not able to work a job.</p>
         <p>
            I grew up as an evangelist kid, so I was on the road 40 weeks a year. I got to go to over 40 states and to several foreign countries including Ireland, Italy and South Africa.   
             When I was 16 the Lord started working in my heart about going into full time vocational ministry. My long term goal is to be a tent maker missionary in Ireland by running a small business 
             and planting a church. My double major will help me to understand both the Bible and the business world. I am very excited for what God has for me in the future!

            I am a total redneck. I wear cowboy boots, cowboy hats, bolo ties, camouflage, and deer hunting t-shirts. I love hunting, fishing, shooting guns, playing guitar, and hiking. I am also a 
             knife maker. I started making knives when I was 15 and absolutely fell in love with it. I do what is called the stock-removal method which means I grind my knives into shape and grind the 
             bevels to form an edge. Knife making is my favorite hobby and I hope to be a master at it one day.
